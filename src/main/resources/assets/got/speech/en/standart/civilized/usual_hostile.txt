Run, # or you'll lose your head.
Run while you still can, #.
In the name of all the world, I will destroy you!
Enemies have entered our lands!
I swear your death will be swift!
We don't like bandits here!
We'll bury you and bury you, #.
No pity for the likes of you!
No enemy of the people is free to enter our lands!
Get out of our lands, you filthy scum!
Get out of here, #!
Away!
The way is closed, you won't get through!
Massacre!
I look forward to the spectacle at the scaffold!
Freeze, drop your weapons, hands on your head!
Your death will be swift, #!
Your place is in the penitentiary, #!
You are not welcome here.
You'd better go of your own free will, #. Or do you like violence?
You won't get away with it, that's for sure.
You're a filthy bitch, #.
You're no friend of mine.
You won't live to see the sunset!
You're a criminal!
Get out of my sight, #!
What do you want, scum?
I won't let you commit atrocities, #!
I won't let you commit sins here!
I advise you to get out of here.
