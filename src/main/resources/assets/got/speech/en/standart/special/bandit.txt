Freeze and don't move! Money or life?!
What a beautiful thing you have, #! I'll take it.
I wouldn't get into a fight if I were you!
I'll get rich off your stuff!
Why do you have to carry so much unnecessary stuff? Let me lighten your load!
Let's see what we have here... aha! Goodbye!
It's about time you paid!
Where are your coins?
Hey, come here! I want to buy something from you...
Your money's mine, slug! Give it to me!
What's that shiny thing in your pocket? Is it a coin? Give it to me!
