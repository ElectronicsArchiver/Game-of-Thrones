Greetings, #. Oh, I didn't think I'd see you now. These are hard times. War everywhere, death everywhere, enemies and traitors everywhere. I'm trying my best to bring peace, but there's no end in sight to the enemies. # Won't you join our army?
#, we need your help. Don't think we're trying to start a war. But war is inevitable. Our former allies have been acting hostile lately. I think we need a preemptive strike or they'll attack us from four positions - I've got a map, I'll show you. In short, peace and order is at stake. Are you with us?
