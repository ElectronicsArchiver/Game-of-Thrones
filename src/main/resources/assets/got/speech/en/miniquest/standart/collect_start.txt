Hello, #. What's your business here? None of my business, though. If you have a moment to spare, could you help me? Our fortress burned down, and we're looking for resources to rebuild it. I'd really appreciate it if you could get us some $.
О, #. It's been a long time since I've seen you. You're right on time, as always. There's a big construction site about five versts away, and we really need resources! It would be good to build the fortress before winter. But we're desperately short of $. Maybe you have it?
