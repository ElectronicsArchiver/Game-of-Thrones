Hello everybody!

I am the developer of the Game of Thrones mod for Minecraft and I have posted the latest source code here. Of course, after a while it will no longer be the newest, but this is not so important.

Since I went to university, I don't have much time to develop the mod. With all this, anyone can download this source code and modify it. I would be grateful if you would share me your developments based on my code - what if your work is so good to enter the official version?
