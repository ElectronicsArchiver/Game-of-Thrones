Hello everybody!

I am the developer of the Game of Thrones mod for Minecraft and I have posted the latest source code here. My repo is located in my Eclipse workspace, so you can see here unreleased beta-features.

Since I went to university, I don't have much time to develop the mod. So, anyone can download this source code or assets and modify it. I would be grateful if you would share me your developments based on my code - what if your work is so good to enter the official version?
