Hello everybody!

I am the developer of the Game of Thrones mod for Minecraft and I have posted the latest source code here. My repo is located in my Eclipse workspace, so you can see here really fresh alpha-features, that were coded a few seconds ago.

You can modify the code and assets freely, but you should make your project open-source. You can also distribute the modified version and install it on the server, but only with my permission.
